# ISS_Satellite_Tracker

A website that helps to track the current location of the International Space Station which has been orbiting the earth.
This website allows a user to track the current location of the space station in google maps in real-time.

The location, distance and speed of the ISS is updated every 5 seconds. 
The user can add the co-ordinates of your location or any other location to see the distance between ISS and the location given as input by the user.

You need to use "Maps JavaScript" API from GCP to visualise the location of the satellite on google maps. Here is a short video to get a look and feel of the website.
